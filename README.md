# Auto Loan Calculator build with React

## Purpose
Built for a coding excercise. React was chosen as I use every opportunity to practice React as I have been working daily with Angular + Typescript.
This calculator will let you see your monthly payment on a car as well as the loan amortization. You may enter a term in years or months, the calculator will auto-convert one value to the other.
